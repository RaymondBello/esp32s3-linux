	-i SECS		Interval
	-A		Ping as soon as reply is received
	-t TTL		Set TTL
	-I IFACE/IP	Source interface or IP address
	-W SEC		Seconds to wait for the first response (default 10)
			(after all -c CNT packets are sent)
	-w SEC		Seconds until ping exits (default:infinite)
			(can exit earlier with -c CNT)
	-q		Quiet, only display output at start/finish
	-p HEXBYTE	Payload pattern
